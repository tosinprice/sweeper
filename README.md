#Sweeper
- Sweeper is a lightweight scanner written in Python that scans PDF files for malware
- It operates with ClamAV and is complemented by a YARA rule.
- This prject also has a front end which you can use to instead of running the script via CLI
- Runs on Linux servers
- Still a work in progress and open to collaborate :)
